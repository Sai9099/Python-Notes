What is Python (Programming)?
------------------------------

(like: Django and Bottle), scientific and mathematical computing (Orange, SymPy, NumPy) to desktop 
graphical user Interfaces (Pygame, Panda3D).

History of Python
-----------------
Python is a fairly old language created by Guido Van Rossum. The design began in the late 1980s 
and was first released in February 1991.

Why Python was created?
-----------------------
In late 1980s, Guido Van Rossum was working on the Amoeba 
distributed operating system 
group. He wanted to use an interpreted language like ABC (ABC has simple easy-to-understand syntax) 
that could access the Amoeba system calls. So, he decided to create a language that was extensible. This 
led to design of a new language which was later named Python.

Why the name Python?
--------------------
No. It wasn't named after a dangerous snake. Rossum was fan of a comedy series from late 
seventies. The name "Python" was adopted from the same series "Monty Python's Flying Circus". Python 
was named for the BBC TV show Monty Python's Flying Circus
