Types of Python Functions:
--------------------------
1.Built-in functions

Python's standard library includes number of built-in functions. Some of Python's built-in functions are print(), int(), len(), sum(), etc. These functions are always available, as they are loaded into computer's memory as soon as you start Python interpreter.

2.Functions defined in built-in modules

The standard library also bundles a number of modules. Each module defines a group of functions. These functions are not readily available. You need to import them into the memory from their respective modules.

3.User-defined functions

In addition to the built-in functions and functions in the built-in modules, you can also create your own functions. These functions are called user-defined functions.


Classification of Functions
----------------------------
# With No Arguments, and No Return Value
def Adding():
    a = 20
    b = 30
    Sum = a + b
    print("After Calling :", Sum)
Adding()

# With No Arguments, and with Return Value
def Multiplication():
    a = 10
    b = 25
    Multi = a * b
    return Multi
print("After Calling the Multiplication : ", Multiplication())

# With Arguments, and NO Return Value
def Multiplications(a, b):
    Multi = a * b
    print("After Calling the Function:", Multi)

Multiplications(10, 20)


# with Arguments, and Return Value
def Addition(a, b):
    Sum = a + b
    return Sum
# We are calling it Outside the Definition
print("After Calling :", Addition(25, 45))
