Python continue Statement
-------------------------
Python continue statement is used to skip the execution of the program block and returns the control to the beginning of the current loop to start the next iteration. When encountered, the loop starts next iteration without executing the remaining statements in the current iteration.

The continue statement is just the opposite to that of break. It skips the remaining statements in the current loop and starts the next iteration.

Python continue Statement with for Loop

for letter in 'Python':
   if letter == 'h':
      continue
   print ('Current Letter :', letter)
print ("Good bye!")


Python continue Statement with while Loop

num = 60
print ("Prime factors for: ", num)
d=2
while num > 1:
   if num%d==0:
      print (d)
      num=num/d
      continue
   d=d+1
