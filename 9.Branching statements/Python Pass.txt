Python pass Statement
---------------------
Python pass statement is used when a statement is required syntactically but you do not want any command or code to execute. It is a null which means nothing happens when it executes. This is also useful in places where piece of code will be added later, but a placeholder is required to ensure the program runs without errors.

for letter in 'Python':
   if letter == 'h':
      pass
      print ('This is pass block')
   print ('Current Letter :', letter)
print ("Good bye!")
